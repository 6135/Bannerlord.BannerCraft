Changelog
1.0.5
Fixed mismatched ordering between what's shown on armor crafting result popup and the actual result.

1.0.4
Changed ordering of armor stats to match vanilla hints
Vanilla hints are stupid and go Head Body Leg Arm which doesn't match inventory total values
Added negative item prefix chance based on skill level. Positive prefixes require Experienced/Master/Legendary Smith perks.
Added mouseover tooltips to items. They look bad but the vanilla ones are done via more hidden magic code.

Version 1.0.3
Added botching chance and smelting to MCM menu

Version 1.0.2
Fixed issue with refinement selection being reset. Repacked to be single folder instead of loose files.

Fixed exception when no items are shown

Version 1.0.0
Initial release
